# SereniTee
## What is SereniTee?
SereniTee is a relaxing, low poly take on procedurally generated mini golf across ever-expanding vibrant, spiritful backdrops.

## How To Play
Simply head on over to https://github.com/DKLynch/SereniTee-Releases/releases/latest and download the newest release .zip. Extract the folder to your desired place and then run SereniTee.exe

NOTE: I recommend running on Medium/High graphics settings at the moment until further optimization has been implemented further down the line.

## Controls
* Q/E - Rotate Camera
* Z/X - Zoom Camera
* V - Camera Hole Flythrough
* LMB/RMB - Hold left click to start shot, let go to take the shot. Right clicking cancels the shot in progress.
* Space - Hop (One hop can be used per stroke while the ball is in motion, and costs an extra stroke)
* F - Reset To Previous Shot Position
* R - Reset To Hole Start
* K - Move to Next Hole (This is currently only in for debug/testing purposes, don't go cheating now :eyes:)
* L - Toggle Ball Light
* T - Toggle Hole Transparency (Used for seeing the ball when it is otherwise obstructed by the hole itself)

## Regarding Open Source
Unfortunately, I do use a paid asset within SereniTee (a low poly water shader) and as I do not wish to redistribute someone else's product, I have elected to keep the repository private for the time being. Further down the line once I've refactored some code snippets that I'm not too pleased with, optimized, organized and beautified my scripts, I'll most likely simply .gitignore the asset and give you all a peek behind the scenes.
